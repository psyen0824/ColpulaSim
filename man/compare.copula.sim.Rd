\usage{
compare.copula.sim(object)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A copula.sim object for the comparison.}
}
\value{

(1) simu.mean: average value of simulated mean
(2) simu.sd: average value of simulated standard error
(3) simu.mean.RB: relative bias for marginal mean
(4) simu.mean.SB: standardized bias for marginal mean
(5) simu.mean.RMSE: root mean square error for marginal mean
\item cov.comparison: comparison between empirical covariance and average value of simulated covariance
